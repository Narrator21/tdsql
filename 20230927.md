# tdsqlpcloud Database configuration information leakage.
## tdsqlpcloud introduce

dsqlpcloud is a distributed database product developed by Tencent, boasting features such as strong consistency, high availability, a global deployment architecture, distributed horizontal scaling, high performance, and enterprise-level security. It also provides complementary facilities like intelligent DBA, automated operations, monitoring, and alerts, delivering a complete distributed database solution to customers

## Vulnerability description

The above-mentioned tdsqlpcloud is a distributed database product with a web installation page. However, within the code, there is a function that by default exposes database IP, port, and account credentials information. This can lead to sensitive information leakage as the corresponding function can be accessed through an interface.

## Loophole principle

In the install.php installation file, there is a function called get_db_info() that retrieves the database's IP, port, and account credentials information and outputs it. Furthermore, this function can be accessed through an unauthorized interface, resulting in information leakage.
